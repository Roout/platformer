List:

[x] Implement attack
    [x] add attack's projectile
    [x] add view to be able to see the attack's body

[ ] Refactoring physic world:
    [ ] let it know the entities it keeps: unit, box, gift, bonus... whatever.

    problems with scale-ability disadvantages than dancing with virtual callbacks.. 
    [ ] fix bug with pointers
    [ ] decide whether it's good to switched to physic world singleton? 

[ ] Distinguish: character is staning on the ground, falling down, jumping up etc.

[ ] Implement unit states:

    - direction: left, right
